  4 Big Advantages of Choosing an Online Casino
---
If you’ve never visited an online casino before then you may be wondering what their appeal is. And if you’re a big fan of land-based casinos, you may be wondering how an online casino can possibly compare. But in reality, when you look at the benefits afforded by online casino sites, they actually have a host of unique advantages that stack up to a really attractive proposition. They’re fast, they’re fun, they’re convenient, and they attract millions of visitors every year.

### **1) Online casinos are legal**

As a general rule, gambling is classed as an illegal act in India. According to the Public Gambling act of 1867, it is illegal to “run, manage or visit a public gambling house”. This means that if you choose to visit a land-based casino in India then not only would you be falling foul of the law, you wouldn’t be afforded the protection of it if you continued to visit a land-based casino and something went wrong. By contrast, online casinos in India don’t fall foul of the law, provided they are owned and operated off-shore. This means that you would be enjoying your hobby legally, and would have the protection of the law on the rare occasion that something went wrong.

### **2) Gamble anytime, anywhere**

When you choose to gamble online, you aren’t constrained by where your nearest casino is or when you can take the weekend away to visit your nearest gambling hub. Instead, you can play anytime, anywhere, and recreate the excitement of a Vegas casino experience from the comfort of your own home. Online casino websites offer fully immersive gaming experiences that will transport you to another world, turning even the most mundane activity (such as riding the bus to work) into an opportunity for fun.

### **3) Learn at Your Own Pace** 

If you’re new to playing casino games, such as poker or baccarat, then playing online is a great way to learn the rules and hone your skills at your own pace. When you’re playing at a land-based casino you generally have to match the pace of the table: both the other players and the speed of the dealer too. By contrast, when you play at an online casino you generally have the time to ruminate over your next move and play without any pressure from more experienced players to keep the game flowing. Whether you’re interested in cards, slots, or sports betting, you set the pace, and the only person you have to please is yourself.

### **4) Brilliant Bonuses**

Finally, online casinos offer a host of excellent bonuses that you wouldn’t get from a land-based casino: from sign up bonuses to free games, and the opportunity to earn points and other rewards. Because the online casino market is a saturated one, you can afford to shop around to find the best bonuses for you and the site that is right for you.
