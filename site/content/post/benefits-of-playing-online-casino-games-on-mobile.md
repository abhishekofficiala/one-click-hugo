At the moment, there are 5.20 billion unique mobile users across the globe. These smart devices are steadily replacing personal computers and it is only a matter of time when people will completely switch to their smartphones. This technology has influenced numerous fields and gambling is not an exception.

Nowadays, people prefer not to waste time and to play on the go while they are driving to work or waiting for a friend in a coffee shop. In this post, we will tell you about the main advantages of gambling on the go. 

### **1) No need to be stuck at home**

The first and the most obvious advantage of mobile casinos over desktop ones is that you don’t have to be glued to your home. It sometimes happens that time-limited tournaments or promotions make you miss a date, a party, or another important event. But with mobile gambling, this issue is no longer a problem. From now on, you can combine business with pleasure without feeling stressed and guilty.

### **2) Board game library**

You probably know that the number of games available at land-based casinos is much lower. Usually, there are a dozen tables and around 50-100 slot machines. At mobile casinos, the lobby can reach thousands of titles and there are new games launched literally every day. This means that you won’t be bored and will always have access to the latest titles.

### **3) Maximum convenience**

The global mobile gaming market is estimated to be worth $79.5 billion by the end of 2020 and such a huge sum is not surprising because one of its main advantages is comfort (and people are eager to pay for it). There is no need to drive to a land-based casino or even to sit at a desk with a personal computer.

The only thing required is a smartphone and Internet connection. At home, you can use a stable Wi-Fi connection and in the streets – Wi-Fi from nearby buildings or stable 3G networks. Stay in your bed and gamble all day long or forget about a boring lecture by spinning the reels in the class. With mobile casinos, you will always feel comfortable.

### **4) Impressive rewards** 

It is not a secret that online casinos offer their players huge bonuses in order to stand the competition and increase the number of loyal users. However, mobile casinos are ready to offer you even more perks. They are relatively new and gambling sites do everything they can to attract new players and motivate them to download an app or log in via browser.

That is why apart from regular promotions, mobile users can expect unique offers and time-limited discounts. And we don’t even need to compare mobile casino rewards with those of land-based venues: you already know which one is the winner.

### **5) No downloads needed** 

You probably remember that the first online casinos ran on complex software and in order to play, you had to download it. The process was time-consuming and involved at least basic technical skills. Fortunately, modern gambling sites are available in an instant mode and rather often you don’t even need to download a mobile application. Just enter the casino’s website via your browser and start playing with a regular login and password.
