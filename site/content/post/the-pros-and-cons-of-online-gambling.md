  The Pros and Cons of Online Gambling
---
Online casinos change entirely the way you can play casino games. When you play online, the first advantage is that you can play any time you want, the games are accessible 24/7, and there’s no need to wait for a table to be free or for a player to stop playing at a slot to access it.

Moreover, most online casinos feature either a downloadable app for iOS and Android or an optimized mobile site that allows you to access your favourite casino games wherever you go. Transactions are also easier online since you can directly deposit on the site with your banking card, a wire transfer, or using an e-wallet.

Online casinos will also offer games you won’t find at land-based casinos, with many providers only offering their titles at online establishments. The number of games present in some casinos is astounding, with some sites featuring thousands of online slots with innovative game mechanics.

The other aspect that pushes many players towards online gambling is that, since the market is highly competitive, many establishments have promotional offers intended to attract them with free rewards such as free spins for online slots or bonus money offered on top of a deposit.

As a Canadian citizen, you have the freedom to play at offshore online casinos, which means that you have access to many reputable online casinos worldwide.

## What You Should Look Out For

Despite everything we’ve previously mentioned, playing online can induce some disadvantages. It can impact the way you play because while having such a service available 24/7 is excellent, for the people who have trouble controlling their urge to play, it can become problematic. The online casinos offer responsible gaming solutions to help these players limit their spending or self-exclude, but how many players really use these features without compulsively creating an account at another online operator (which takes a few clicks).

In Canada, players can freely play at offshore casinos, and it should be mentioned that not every online casino is trustworthy. Before playing at an online casino, always do your research; if the casino doesn’t offer a proper license from a reputable gaming commission, you should steer clear. Moreover, it’s crucial to go over some online feedback to ensure the casino plays fair and that you’ll get paid at the end of the day.

Although depositing is instantaneous, you’ll have to wait a few days to receive your winnings when it comes to withdrawing. This can be frustrating, and that’s why many players turn to cryptocurrencies for faster transactions, but this isn’t accessible to everyone.
